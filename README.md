In this project, I focused on predicting loan approval outcomes using machine learning algorithms. The goal was to determine whether a loan applicant should be granted a loan or not.
Here are the key points:

Dataset: i worked with a curated dataset containing loan records.
Data Exploration: i analyzed the dataset, identifying patterns, correlations, and exploring the impact of various features on loan approval rates.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: i proactively handled missing values, removed irrelevant columns, and balanced class distribution through oversampling.
Model Building: i implemented machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier.
Hyperparameter Tuning: i fine-tuned the Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV to optimize accuracy.
User Interaction: i developed an interactive UI for real-time user input, allowing individuals to receive transparent loan eligibility predictions.
